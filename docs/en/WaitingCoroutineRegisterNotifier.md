# WritingCoroutineRegisterNotifier class

This document is intended for library developers.

[WaitingCoroutineRegisterNotifier](../../src/AwaitableCoroutine/Internal/WaitingCoroutineRegisterNotifier.cs)
class is an interface to implement the behavior in asynchronous methods that create an `Coroutine` that when the waiting object is canceled, the asynchronous method is also canceled.

This behavior can be rewritten by setting the `Instance` static property to an instance of a class that inherits from this class.

The standard implementation of the `WaitingCoroutineRegisterNotifier` is to call the `RegisterWaitingCoroutine` method of an Awaiter that implements the `IWaitingCoroutineRegisterer` interface. CoroutineRegisterNotifier` is registered and called.

For other Awaitable types, if you want to cancel the coroutines generated by asynchronous methods that create `Coroutine` when the object is canceled, create a class that handles the registration process and register it.
